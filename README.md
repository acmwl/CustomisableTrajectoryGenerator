The CustomisableTrajectoryGenerator is a simple trajectory generator, used to simulate data tracked from user movements in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
Each user follows a general set of rectangles, called Regions of Interest. These rectangles are generated by a sub-generator that chooses new random rectangles in a radius around the last user position. This generator can be modified to give specific regions according to a given space (either indoor or outdoor).
The movements inside each region are steps taken according to customizable parameters. Specifically, each user takes a random number of steps, each step in a random direction, using a random distance. The steps are taken inside the Region of interest given each time.
The goal of this project was to craft an easy way to generate indoor trajectories, which are famously hard to come by in real data. The resulting trajectories, in the case of this project, were later used to test an algorithm that approximates the rectangles that represent said Regions of interest, in order to store and index different users in a spatial index like an R-Tree.
The images shown are a part of said project, using trajectories generated using given parameters. All parameters can be adjusted in the RNG class.
